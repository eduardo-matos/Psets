# Psets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eduardo-matos/Psets.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eduardo-matos/Psets)
Working with sets of DateTime intervals in PHP.

## Testing
First make sure you have all dependencies resolved (`composer install --dev` might be enough). Then run `vendon/bin/phpunit`, and hopefully it will work.
